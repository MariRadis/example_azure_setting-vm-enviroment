#Responsibilities:
# this code is what would go to bootstrap but also what would go to customer project initialization module ( resason is that this is out of scope for this task)

#Create subscription that in this case is create project for customer and subscription that would have all state buckets
#
#Enable APIs
# This bootstrap "code" would create admin users , but this is not needed for this task
#
# locally I use my user, but would it be better to do impersonation of sa for this customer project (one sa per env:prd,test... )
# I need also one workload federation for github ci/cd
#
# Bootstrap is for init staff and also has states so that is easy to remove state on resource deletion
#üõ†Ô∏è What Should Bootstrap Create?
#Here‚Äôs what you typically want in your Terraform bootstrap phase:
#
#1. üéØ Resource Group (for state)
#2. üì¶ Storage Account + Container (for Terraform state)
#3. üîê Federated Identity Setup:
#Azure AD App Registration
#
#Federated Credential for GitHub, GitLab, or GCP OIDC
#
#Azure Role Assignment (e.g. Storage Blob Data Contributor)
#üß† Why Put WIF Setup in the Bootstrap Project?
#Because WIF must exist before GitHub Actions can run any Terraform with Azure authentication.
#
#So:
#
#‚úîÔ∏è Bootstrap project = runs locally to provision:
#
#State storage
#
#AAD App + SP
#
#Federated credential
#
#Role assignment to storage
#
#üßë You run it manually once per subscription/customer.
#
#Then:
#
#ü§ñ GitHub Actions can run later Terraform securely using the OIDC identity you bootstrapped.
